# Container-to-Systemd
This application creates a systemd service based container from a docker image and debianizes it by creatig a DEBIAN package for DEBIAN based Linux distribuitons like Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, Armbian etc. 

It creates a debian package from docker image mentioned in the script then it creates a docker container and it converts this docker container to a systemd service and enables start, stop and restart of Docker container via systemd service. Also as a systemd service, docker container will be automatically started during boot phase. 

For current usage, I selected Netdata docker image to convert. Netdata is Real-time performance monitoring tool for Linux systems. 

Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/netdata/netdata

General Features of Application: 
- This application automatically pulls the requested docker image from docker hub, for this purpose you need to have a valid 
  docker hub membership.
- After pulling the docker image from docker hub, it creates a .tar file from this image by saving it to locate it in debian package. 
- After loading debian package to any Debian based LINUX distrubition, systemd service loads the docker image and creates a docker 
  container with predefined configuration in contol script. 
- Container Systemd service is able to start, stop, restart, enable and disable the container via systemctl command.

```
- After build ends, a DEBIAN package will be created under output folder.

```
vm@vm-VirtualBox:~/container-to-systemd$ ls output/

netdata-debian_1.0.0_amd64.deb

```

## Installation

- All the `code` required to get started
```
dpkg -i  netdata-debian_1.0.0_amd64.deb

```

### Setup

1. After installing DEBIAN package in your LINUX platform, go to web browser and go to link: 

   http://localhost:19999/
   
   You will see the NETDATA frontend page that shows all funny resource usages in your system
   
2. You can stop, start and restart Netdata application with below commands: 
   ```
   systemctl status netdata-debian
   ```
   ```
   systemctl stop netdata-debian
   ```
   ```
   systemctl start netdata-debian
   ```
   ```
   systemctl restart netdata-debian
   ```  
   
3. For completely removing "netdata-debian" package, use below command
   ```
   dpkg -P netdata-debian
   ```  
   By removing "netdata-debian" systemd service, docker image and container will be deleted. Also other files will be removed 
   
## FAQ

- **How can I use this application for a different Dcoker image ?**
    - In this application, for sample usage I selected NETDATA docker image, you can change control script and build script to create a 
    different Docker systemd service for your specific Docker image.
